We presented an automated calibration procedure that is able to identify optima from a relatively wide range of input parameters without convergence issues of the nonlinear operator. We also showed numerical considerations in the domain set-up of a challenging problem. We show that starting with the semi-explicit scheme can identify regions of interest. However, the identified SHP can change dramatically with an improved numerical set-up, so that several stages of refinement are required until SHP estimates can be confirmed. We also acknowledge that for this calibration to work, the optimization algorithm needs to be able to identify multiple optima. 

We applied the methodology to synthetic and a real transient SR infiltration data. Our synthetic infiltration problems show that identification of soils with unimodal grain size distribution can result in multiple distinct optima with good fitting properties. Although some optima show good fits, the parameters are not necessarily physical/reasonable in the eyes of the expert. For both, the synthetic and real problems, expert knowledge on the saturated water content can aid the identification of the most reasonable optimum.
