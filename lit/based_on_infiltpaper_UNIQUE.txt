 the main contribution of this research is presentation of a methodology for the optimization of individual parameters, which guarantees the uniqueness of parameter values [KAMALI 2016 | TRANS. ASABE | 0]
 in contrast, simultaneous optimization of the entire parameter set would not necessarily lead to unique values [KAMALI 2016 | TRANS. ASABE | 0]

 the uniqueness of the inverse solution was analyzed using numerical experiments to estimate two soil hydraulic parameters (alpha, n) of the mualemvan genuchten model [NAKHAEI 2015 | J. POROUS MEDIA | 0]
 in this paper it is shown that it is possible to identify all the hydraulic parameters of sand by using a unique column test, which is a gravity drainage test where only the flow-rate temporal evolution is measured [LAZRAG 2013 | J. POROUS MEDIA | 3]
 the objective of this article is to formulate an effective process description of dynamic nonequilibrium flow in variably saturated soil which is both flexible enough to match experimental observations and as parsimonious as possible to allow unique parameter estimation by inverse modeling [DIAMANTOPOULOS 2012 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 17]
 however, the inverse problem in unsaturated zone is ill-posed due to various reasons, and hence the parameters become non-unique [KUMAR 2010 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 12]
 unique and fast reproduction of soil hydraulic properties for generated data was obtained [LAZAROVITCH 2007 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 161]
 however, ill-posedness and nonuniqueness commonly arise in such non-linear inverse problems making their solutions elusive [KOWALSKY 2004 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 89]
 here, we present a unique dataset that consists of 310 soil-water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions, all of which were obtained from the multistep outflow method [MINASNY 2004 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 69]
 we found that in one-step experiments the increment of pressure would reduce the non-uniqueness of inverse technique and that in multi-step experiment the combination of cumulative outflow with pressure head in the objective function would improve the final estimation and also reduce the non-uniqueness of inverse problem [ZHANG 2004 | J. HYDRODYN. | 0]
 parameter identifiability is evaluated through sensitivity and uniqueness analyses [ZHANG 2003 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 39]
 applying the inverse method to a field drainage experiment in sandy soil showed that all the van genuchten (1980) hydraulic parameters could be estimated uniquely when both water content (theta) and pressure head (h) data were used [ZHANG 2003 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 39]
estimating unique soil hydraulic parameters is required to provide input for numerical models simulating transient water flow in the vadose zone [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 in this paper, we analyze the capability of six soil hydraulic functions to provide unique parameter sets for sandy soils from multi-step outflow data [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 initial parameter estimates and experimental boundary conditions were explored to determine their affect on the uniqueness of soil hydraulic functions [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 of the hydraulic functions tested, the lognormal distribution-mualem (ldm) function provided the best performance and a unique solution for error-free numerically generated multi-step outflow data [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 for experimental multi-step outflow data with inherent measurement errors, the ldm function again showed better performance and uniqueness than the van genuchten-mualem and gardner-mualem functions [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 in experiments with different boundary conditions, the ldm function provided the best fitting ability, resulting in unique parameter sets when the intrinsic permeability (k) was fixed at its measured value [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 the experiment that had a greater number of pneumatic pressure steps, thereby causing a lower flow rate, provided better fitting ability and more unique solutions than faster experiments [HWANG 2003 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 18]
 inversion of the simulated error-free data and examination of the related response surfaces demonstrated the uniqueness of the inverse solution and the suitability of the gmcs-nms strategy when identifying four key parameters of the hydraulic functions described by the mualem-van genuchten model [LAMBOT 2002 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 69]
 generally, their effects sometimes lead to non-uniqueness in the solution but to some extent are partly handled by ga [INES 2002 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 491]
 the sensitivity of parameter estimation and the uniqueness of the inverse problem were dramatically improved when the second part of the objective function was included [ZOU 2001 | J. HYDROL. | 26]
 however, problems are often encountered with the non-uniqueness of the parameter estimates [VRUGT 2001 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 67]
 non-unique parameter estimates result in case of low parameter sensitivity, mutual parameter dependency, and high measurement noise [VRUGT 2001 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 67]
 to illustrate pimli we chose a simulated multi-step outflow (mso) experiment in which only cumulative outflow is measured because of its well-known problems with the uniqueness of the identified soil hydraulic properties, the results show that pimli not only leads to unique parameter sets of soil hydraulic properties for a range of soils but also significantly improves the understanding of uniqueness problems related to parameter identification [VRUGT 2001 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 67]
 further insights into the properties of existence and uniqueness of inverse solutions are gained by examining contour plots of the objective functions under varying experimental conditions [ROMANO 1999 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 66]
 for both porous media unique solutions of the inverse problem could be obtained, and afterwards, the corresponding hydraulic functions were verified from additional drainage experiments [NUTZMANN 1998 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 25]
 this was confirmed by inverse optimization runs with simultaneous optimization of up to six parameters, which consistently converged from different initial values to the true parameter values, indicating uniqueness of the inverse problem [ZURMUHL 1998 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 49]
 attempts to fit the bimodal outflow data with simulations using unimodal hydraulic functions were not successful, as expressed by systematic disagreement between fitted and ``observed'' data and nonuniqueness of the inverse [ZURMUHL 1998 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 49]
 in this paper we analyze the possibility of using cumulative infiltration rates obtained at several consecutive tensions for the purpose of estimating soil hydraulic parameters, we also investigate whether additional, easily obtainable information improves identifiability of the unknown parameters, the study is carried out using numerically generated data, the uniqueness problem was analyzed by studying the behavior of response surfaces in the optimized parameter planes, our parameter estimation procedure combines the levenberg-marquardt nonlinear parameter optimization method with a quasi three-dimensional numerical model, hydrus-2d, which solves the variably-saturated flow equation, we found that the combination of multiple tension cumulative infiltration data with measured values of the initial and final water contents yielded unique solutions of the inverse problem for the unknown parameters [SIMUNEK 1997 | SOIL SCI. | 75]
 the one-step outflow data and the independently measured retention data are included in the objective function of a traditional least-squares minimization routine, providing unique estimates of the unsaturated hydraulic characteristics by means of numerical inversion of richards equation [WILDENSCHILD 1997 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 36]
 data sets of different size and with various degrees of perturbation are used to investigate existence, uniqueness and accuracy of parameter estimates [ZIJLSTRA 1996 | J. HYDROL. | 23]
 using outflow data only in the objective function, and applying the optimization algorithm of marquardt's maximum neighborhood, the multistep outflow method results in unique estimates of the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions [VANDAM 1994 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 198]
 for the same experimental conditions the one-step outflow method often yields nonunique solutions [VANDAM 1994 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 198]
 additional soil water information is needed to improve the estimation procedure and to minimize uniqueness problems [ECHING 1993 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 120]
the estimation of model parameters using non-linear regression techniques is one of the aspects of inverse modelling and is known as the identification problem, the solution of which may be non-unique [MOUS 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 21]
 the main causes of this non-uniqueness are the structure of the model and the design of the input signal [MOUS 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 21]
 this model appears to be non-identifiable, which results in non-unique solutions [MOUS 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 21]
 many investigators, however, encountered difficulties obtaining a unique solution to the problem [TOORMAN 1992 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 72]
 however, estimates from one-step outflow experiments, using only cumulative outflow data in the objective function, are often unreliable and non-unique [VANDAM 1992 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 99]
  reported problems are associated with the nonuniqueness and instability of the solution, as well as with the flow conditions that exist in the soil as a result of the high pressure difference across the sample [HOPMANS 1992 | SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J. | 65]
 we show that this parameter identification problem, in some cases, has a unique solution [ZACHMANN 1991 | TRANSP. POROUS MEDIA | 1]
  suggesting the use of infiltration data for this purpose, and recognizing the fact that a basic requirement for the design of a transient flow experiment is that the resulting inverse problem be sufficiently well posed to allow solution, this paper addresses the question under which circumstances the resulting inverse problem is well posed, utilizing the concepts of identifiability, uniqueness, and stability [RUSSO 1991 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 111]
  the main conclusion of this study is that when infiltration data measured at the darcy scale are used as input for the inversion procedure, the inclusion of prior information on a single measurable parameter, the saturated conductivity k(s), in the estimation criterion will enhance the likelihood of uniqueness and stability of the inverse solution provided that the structure of the hydraulic model is sufficiently simple [RUSSO 1991 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 111]
 nonhysteretic saturation-pressure relations are described using a scaled parametric function, assumed to be unique to the porous medium and fluid-pair dependent scaling coefficients which scale s-w(h(ow)) and s-t(h(ao)) in three fluid-phase systems or s-w(h(aw)) in two fluid-phase systems, where sw and st are water and total liquid saturation and h(ow), h(ao), and h(aw) are napl-water, air-napl and air-water capillary pressures, respectively [PARKER 1990 | J. PET. SCI. ENG. | 141]

 although none of the inverse problems converged on a unique, best-fit parameter set, a minimum standard error of regression was reached for each deposit type [MIRUS 2009 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 18]
 due to the scarcity of these observations, it has been found that parameter sets allowing a good matching between simulated and measured quantities are often non-unique, leading to the problem of equifinality [POLLACCO 2008 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 16]
 the linking test establishes the causes of non-uniqueness of parameter sets and the feasibility of the inverse modelling [POLLACCO 2008 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 16]
 the results showed that only the hydraulic conductivity and one of the parameters ( empirical parameter n) describing the soil moisture release curve for three of the five layers could be constrained by the data, illustrating the nonuniqueness of the problem [LOOMS 2008 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 571]
 flow parameters cannot be uniquely identified, showing that the system is over parameterized with respect to the information content of the (nearly stationary) radar profiles [CASSIANI 2005 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 55]
