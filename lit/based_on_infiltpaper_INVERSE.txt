the potentiality of combining large-scale inverse modelling of unsaturated flow with remote sensing determination of areal evaporation and areal surface moisture is assessed [FEDDES 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 48]
 the inverse problem is formulated with respect to the type of information available [FEDDES 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 48]
 it is concluded that small-scale soil physics may describe large-scale hydrological behaviour adequately, and that the effective hydraulic parameters concerned may be derived by an inverse modelling approach [FEDDES 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 48]
 the inverse modelling approach presented combined with a meso-scale data set on evaporation and surface soil moisture, considerable potentialities arise to determine effective meso-scale hydraulic properties [FEDDES 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 48]
the estimation of model parameters using non-linear regression techniques is one of the aspects of inverse modelling and is known as the identification problem, the solution of which may be non-unique [MOUS 1993 | J. HYDROL. | 21]
  suggesting the use of infiltration data for this purpose, and recognizing the fact that a basic requirement for the design of a transient flow experiment is that the resulting inverse problem be sufficiently well posed to allow solution, this paper addresses the question under which circumstances the resulting inverse problem is well posed, utilizing the concepts of identifiability, uniqueness, and stability [RUSSO 1991 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 111]
  the main conclusion of this study is that when infiltration data measured at the darcy scale are used as input for the inversion procedure, the inclusion of prior information on a single measurable parameter, the saturated conductivity k(s), in the estimation criterion will enhance the likelihood of uniqueness and stability of the inverse solution provided that the structure of the hydraulic model is sufficiently simple [RUSSO 1991 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 111]
  however, since for a particular situation, it is impossible to determine a priori whether the resultant inverse problem is well posed or not, this must be carried out only a posteriori by solving the problem several times with different initial parameter estimates, accompanied by an analysis of the associated estimation errors [RUSSO 1991 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 111]
 the shps for the top soil layer were identified here by inverse modeling of the sr infiltration process, where, especially, the initial unsteady part of the experiment can provide very useful data for evaluating the retention curve parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity [KURAZ 2017 | NA | 0]
 this inverse analysis is the main topic of this paper [KURAZ 2017 | NA | 0]
effective soil hydraulic parameters of soil vegetation atmosphere transfer (svat) models can be derived in a cost-efficient way by inverse modeling [POLLACCO 2013 | SOIL SCI. | 2]
 our results show that using inflow alone does not provide a unique solution to the inverse problem [MBOH 2012 | NEAR SURF. GEOPHYS. | 8]
 the uncertainty in data accuracy and the error amplification inherent in deriving velocity estimates from gradients of arrival times make this an example of an ill-posed inverse problem [VIGNOLI 2012 | GEOPHYSICS | 9]
 we apply a method based on the minimum support stabilizer to the vrp traveltime inverse problem [VIGNOLI 2012 | GEOPHYSICS | 9]
 the bayesian-mcmc methodology allows us to explore the potential benefits of including the geophysical data into the inverse problem by examining their effect on our ability to identify fast flowpaths in the subsurface, and their impact on hydrological prediction uncertainty [IRVING 2010 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 44]
 effective parameter values were estimated for a simplified model based on richards' equation using a flow simulator (vs2d), an inverse algorithm (ucode\_2005), and matric pressure and water content data from three ponded infiltration experiments [MIRUS 2009 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 18]
 the inverse problem framework was designed to account for the effects of subsurface lateral spreading of infiltrated water [MIRUS 2009 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 18]
 although none of the inverse problems converged on a unique, best-fit parameter set, a minimum standard error of regression was reached for each deposit type [MIRUS 2009 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 18]
 the inverse-modeling results, however, indicate that with increasing age, the steep slope of the soil water retention curve shifts toward more negative matric pressures [MIRUS 2009 | VADOSE ZONE J. | 18]
 the simulations depend upon parameters which are not always measurable quantities and must be calibrated against observations, using for instance inverse modelling [POLLACCO 2008 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 16]
 therefore, a simple but robust inverse method coined the linking test is presented to determine if the parameters are linked [POLLACCO 2008 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 16]
 the linking test establishes the causes of non-uniqueness of parameter sets and the feasibility of the inverse modelling [POLLACCO 2008 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 16]
 a significant inverse correlation between the surface area to pore volume ratio and tau is observed, suggesting that tau is a measure of a characteristic hydraulic length scale [BINLEY 2005 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 135]
