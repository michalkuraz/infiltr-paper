\noindent Dear Reviewers,

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Please find enclosed a revised version of our manuscript
{\it ``Inverse modeling of a single ring infiltration experiment: a key for analyzing unsaturated hydraulic properties of soils?''.}

\medskip
\noindent We would like to thank both referees and editors
for their valuable and constructive remarks and
comments. 
All remarks and proposals have been addressed in the current revision.
We believe that the revision according to both review reports has increased the level
of the paper.

First of all we should highlight here, that the title of our paper has been updated for

\medskip

\noindent {\it "Scanning methodology to avoid convergence issues during inverse identification of soil unsaturated hydraulic properties."}

\medskip

\noindent since we would like to underline the most import contribution of our work -- the calibration methodology.

\noindent

 For your convenience, we have highlighted all changes in \mich{red} in the revised manuscript,
and we further include bulleted list detailing all changes in the manuscript
according the referees' remarks and comments.

\bigskip

\noindent Yours sincerely,

\medskip

\section*{Referee~\#1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it    The abstract is very long; I suggest shortening it to convey the major points of this research.} \\
{\bf answer:} Folowing your advice  the abstract has been significantly reduced and rewritten.

\item {\it Typically, the last paragraph of the introduction section is reserved for describing the aim, innovation, general methodology of the research. This is missing from this manuscript. I like the fact that the authors present their research questions, but they also need to briefly describe the methodology used to answer them and how it is novel.} \\ 
{\bf  answer:} We completely agree with this remark, an extra section according to your advice has been added.

\item
